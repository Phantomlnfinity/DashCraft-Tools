**NOTE:** The folder will be 2 layers deep because of how Github exports the files (something like `C:\Users\Username\Downloads\dashcraft-track-importer-main\dashcraft-track-importer-main`).

Then, click the puzzle piece icon icon at the top right and pin the extension.

## Using the extension
To start, open DashCraft and click on the extension icon. It should come up with a screen that looks something like this:

- The first box is the input. You can either put in a track link or JSON data of the track pieces. Once you put in the link or JSON, it'll automatically load the track.
- The extension also allows you to move the track around. This allows you to reposition the track vertically, off-grid, or outside of the stadium. Keep in mind that 15 units here is equal to 1 unit in game.
- Finally, you can also rotate the track. DashCraft stores rotations in degrees, so you're able to have rotations that are impossible to achieve in-game.
<br>After changing the settings, follow the instructions given at the bottom.
